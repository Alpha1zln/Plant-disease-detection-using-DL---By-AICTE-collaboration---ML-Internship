The development of an AI-driven Plant Disease Detection System leveraging deep learning to automate and enhance plant health monitoring. 
Traditional methods, such as manual inspections and expert consultations, are time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical for large-scale agricultural settings. 
To overcome these challenges, the proposed system employs real-time image-based disease identification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on plant leaf images.

Stmnt:
Traditional methods of detecting plant diseases, such as manual inspections by farmers or agricultural experts, are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors. Inaccuracies arise due to human limitations, variability in disease symptoms, and delayed diagnosis, which can lead to severe crop losses and reduced agricultural productivity. These challenges are more significant in large-scale farms, where monitoring thousands of plants manually is impractical.
An automated plant disease detection system based on deep learning offers a fast, accurate, and scalable solution. By leveraging image-based disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system can detect diseases at an early stage, ensuring timely intervention and reducing dependency on expert knowledge.
Why is this significant?
•
Efficiency: Provides real-time disease detection, reducing reliance on manual inspections.
•
Accuracy: Reduces human error by leveraging deep learning-based classification.
•
Cost-Effective: Minimizes crop losses by enabling early and precise disease intervention.
•
Scalability: Suitable for large agricultural lands, greenhouses, and precision farming.



CONCLUSION:
The Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning system is a transformative solution that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and 
computer vision to revolutionize traditional plant health monitoring. This project highlights the seamless integration of deep learning techniques
